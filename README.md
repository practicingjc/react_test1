This is a React+Vite test for a problem I'm having. I set this up using create vite <app_name>, cd app_name, npm install, npm run dev. Then made all my edits in VsCode. I don't know what you'll need to do to use this repo and recreate that environment.

The issue I'm havingis that I am trying to use the useRef to calculate the width of a div (scrollWidth). To get that data before paint, I am trying to use useLayoutEffect. However, I get 0 on load, the on saving the file in VsCode, I get 0 again, but the pictures load, if I save the file in VsCode again the value populates.

I clearly don't understand a lot of what's going on here.
